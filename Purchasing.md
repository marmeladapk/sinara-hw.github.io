Anyone is free to build their own copies of Sinara hardware based on schematics and layouts in the repository. We are working with a commercial partner to manufacture and stock the hardware for convenience.

# Future production 

Some hardware is still in the prototype stage. Production schedule varies with part number. 
November 2018 poll: edit this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fORz_zJ0GBtJGL3Tf0nKBD05n9a7QR2Da84x_u_lai8/edit?usp=sharing) to indicate your group's level of interest. 

# R2 Quantities -- open for purchase

You can now buy the following boards (fully populated and tested, complete with aluminium front panels):

- VHDCI_carrier
- BNC_DIO
- SMA_DIO
- RJ45_DIO
- Kasli
- Urukul 9910
- Urukul 9912
- Clocker
- Zotino
- Sampler
- SATA to SFP (media converter)
- BNC to IDC adapter
- HD68 to IDC adapter

Note that all hardware is currently in the v2 prototype stage, so (hopefully minor) changes are expected for the final revision. Changes are tracked on the Sinara GitHub project.

For bare boards, the supplier is TechnoSystem, who accept PayPal or purchase orders. Email Wojciech Niedźwiedź (wniedzwiedz at technosystem.com.pl), copying in Grzegorz Kasprowicz (kasprowg  at  gmail.com) to get a quote. Lead time depends on board type, some are kept on stock, some are produced in batches on request. 

Buying bare boards requires assembly and willingness to understand, configure, and build ARTIQ (compile FPGA bitstreams, firmware, flash the boards, etc.). Those who want a pre-assembled chassis and more than community support need to contact sales at m-labs.hk to get a quote. Payment by bank transfer, credit card, or bitcoin.
