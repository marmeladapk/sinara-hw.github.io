# Review funding
@jbqubit summarizes progress on funding topics in [#17](https://github.com/m-labs/sayma/issues/17)
* m-labs contract start date was 10/18 for AWG Demo, Synchronized AWG demo, Ultrascale port, basic board support for Sayma and Metlino -- depends on DRTIO
* Oxford funding of DRTIO will be "filled in a week or so"; this is holding up the Synchronized AWG demo
* @jbqubit is testing JESD204B and AD9154 demo delivered by m-labs as [reported](https://ssl.serverraum.org/lists-archive/artiq/2016-October/001021.html) on mailing list

# Discussion
[#8](https://github.com/m-labs/sayma/issues/8) analog mezzanine interface discussed.

# [#22](https://github.com/m-labs/sayma/issues/22)
Discussed status. Schematics are complete. 

# [#21](https://github.com/m-labs/sayma/issues/21)
When operating Sayma ARM+RTM on benchtop use the following.
- communication with Core Device (MCH) 
    - AMC backplane Port 4 uses transceivers to communicate with Core Device 
    - a SATA connector on the AMC backplane is also connected to Port 4 (passive) 
    - in stand-alone configuration use a to SATA to SFP adapter to connect ARTIQ Master with board
    - no change in gateware is needed
- power with +12V ATX power supply (common in PCs)
    - [ ] @gkasprow is this the 4-pin connector in the upper right-hand corner? [link](http://www.ohwr.org/projects/afck/wiki)

Chassis:
- [ ] @gkasprow RTM RF backplane part number for 6-slot chassis
- [ ] @gkasprow RTM RF backplane part number for 12-slot chassis

# [#27](https://github.com/m-labs/sayma/issues/27)
@sbouhabib raises an important consideration. Path from RTM clock generation slot to the Sayma RTM analog mezzanine traverses many steps. Many transitions... 
- RTM clock generation module
- connector to RF backplane
- connector to Sayma RTM motherboard
- connector to Sayma RTM clock mezzanine 
@sbouhabib What did you find? 

Narrow-band 100 MHz distribution directly to the Sayma RTM clock mezzanine avoids these difficulties. Low phase noise narrow band distribution amplifiers are available. 
- SDI HPDA-100RM-A operates at 100 MHz, 1:5 $3k/ea ; 1:10 version also available [link](http://www.spectradynamics.com/products/hpda-100rm-high-performance-distribution-amplifier-80-20mhz/)
- Wenzel Associates makes a variant of the LNDA-3 at 100 MHz, 1:3k $538/ea [link]
