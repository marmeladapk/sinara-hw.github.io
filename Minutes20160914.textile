### Wednesday Sept 7

start at 0900 at WUT

Activity 1 (2 hr) :: project management planning
    lead: Jordens/Britton
    * develop weekly plan for design-layout phase (4-weeks  + 6-weeks)
    * develop list of tasks and studies
    * assign priority, difficulty, order of implementation
    * plan structure of weekly reports and teleconferences
    * discuss m-labs project leadership
    * how to handle design changes, regressions (formal check off?, cost/time deltas?)

Activity 2 (2 hr) :: m-labs advice on hardware design
    lead: Jordens
    Design choices that m-labs is concerned about relating to Sayma design (8/25). 
        * DRAM choice
        * multi-board-multi-chip-sync (clock distribution chip meeting JESD204B subclass1 specification)
        * FPGA {family, size, speed grade}
        * Ethernet MAC inclusion (or not)
        * choice of serial interface chip
        * thermal stability required for DAC stability at the LSB level
        * management, maintenance, review and integration of WUT housekeeping code
        * WUT subcontracting with m-labs to write test benches for hardware
        * configuration of on-board peripherals like power, PLL< clock distribution IC's; m-labs (FPGA) or WUT (uP)? 

LUNCH

Activity 3 (2.5 hr) :: discussion with Oxford
    lead: Tom Harty, Weida Zhang, Britton/Jordens
        * Britton/Jordens: review Warsaw discussion from Tuesday relating to det-lac mcs
      * Zhang: power supply noise minimization/rejection (source document "Milldown Board Phase Noise Measurement Report 20151102 (2).docx")
        * Harty/Zhang: DAC_CLK generation by daughter card (source document "Oxford time distribution 20160618.pdf")
        * Harty/Zhang: analog input daughter card (Aug 2 email thread)

Activity 3 (1 hr) :: discussion of other components 
    lead: Britton/Jordens
   other ICs on devices:
        * m-labs asks confirm that "IPMI, PS config, system management, FTDI config, JESD204B (but not synchronization) are covered by WUT."
   metlino_motherboard
        * discuss inclusion of hard-core ARM IC (future-proofing, ETH)
        * XCO choice 
   sayma_motherboard
        * precision voltage reference needs specification
        * XCO choice
    sayma_daughter_output_logiq_2w_0 
        * analog component temperature coefficients:  DACs, amplifiers, etc. 
         * power supply noise rejection
    
Activity 4 (1 hr) :: funding mechanisms/grants beyond present project scope
    * Kasprowicz: EU Horizon 2020
    * Britton: OSD 
    * European partners academic, commercial
    * discuss priorities for respective partners

Activity 4 (0.5 hr) :: hardware distribution plan
lead: Kasprowicz
    * how has this worked in the past? 
    * work with commercial partner like Creotech to collect orders, build, test and distribute boards
    * markup for on-going board support and bug fixes?
    * cost sharing structure?
