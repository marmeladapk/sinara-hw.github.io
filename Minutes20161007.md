**What is Speed grade of FPGA**
-Greg has good price on -1 
- -1 speed grade implication
- QPLL will have to clock all the GTH
- [ ]  file an issue on this, Robert will do this
	
**FPGA on RTM?**
- target problem: reduces number of J30/J31 pins needed for low-speed IO
- questions to answer:
    - 1. which FPGA?
    - 2. how to configure FPGA (shared flash on AMC, JTAG chain, other?)
    - 3. clock source
    - 4. synchronization of signals emitted by FPGA
    - 5. data format for communication between AMC FPGA and RTM FPGA
        eg 8 copies of 8:1 serdes for mezzanine, 1 copy of 32:1 for other IO
    - 6. transport layer (transceiver or else)
		
**analog Mezzanine interface**
- Rogers on both sides? 
    - -> Yes, use Rogers 4350B for top and bottom layers
    - -> 20 mil top, 20 mil bottom, 4 layers of Rogers pre-preg in middle 
- multi-cavity shields using Harwin covering full mezzanine
- drawing showing clearance board-to-board
- separate shielded RF cavities for each analog channel?
     -> yes… plan for this
- heat dissipation 
    - > press-on Harwin for now 
- power
    - better to use +/- 7 V (low noise)
        -> use +6V, 2 A per mezzanine
	- only +12 is needed (-12 can be generated using charge pump)
    - noise "1 mV pp" for +/-7V and 3.3V
	- each potential on mezzanine is generated by individual LDO
	- what spectrum for noise is tolerable? 
	- what is supply rejection of typical chips? 
    - noise "50 mV pp" for +12 
	- what spectrum 
	- what is supply rejection of typical chips? 
	- can we tolerate switching supplies on daughter cards… No! says Joe
	- LDO power chips on AMC or RTM? 

**How much space is needed from clock modules?**
    - Oxford? 
    - Engagement on github is ideal
