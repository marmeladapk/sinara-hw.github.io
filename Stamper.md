Provisional name for a TDC EEM. Specification TBD...

Depending on performance requirements, a simple TDC could be implemented using a dedicated chipset e.g. [TDC-GPX2](http://ams.com/eng/Products/Precision-Time-Measurement/Time-to-Digital-Converters/TDC-GPX2).  Several such chips could fit on an EEM and talk over SPI to Kasli/Metlino.  This would be for relatively low throughput rates of events.
